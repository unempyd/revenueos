# Product Marketing Operations

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## The Team: 9 Specialist Agents

| # | Agent | File | What They Do |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Positioning Strategist | `agents/pmm-positioning-strategist.md` | Develops market positioning that differentiates against competitors, establishes owned category/language, and creates message architecture that cascades through all marketing and sales |
| 2 | Messaging Architect | `agents/pmm-messaging-architect.md` | Translates positioning into buyer-resonant messaging, creates value proposition statements, develops proof points and customer proof, and ensures messaging consistency across channels |
| 3 | Launch Manager | `agents/pmm-launch-manager.md` | Plans and executes product launches and feature releases with coordinated demand generation, PR, analyst relations, sales enablement, and customer communication |
| 4 | Competitive Intelligence Specialist | `agents/pmm-competitive-intelligence.md` | Monitors competitive landscape, analyzes competitor positioning and capabilities, identifies market gaps, runs the win/loss interview program, and builds incumbent-displacement intelligence — contract clocks, switching costs and EU Data Act switching rights |
| 5 | Customer Advocacy Lead | `agents/pmm-customer-advocacy.md` | Builds customer advocacy programs including case studies, customer testimonials, analyst briefing participation, community programs, and G2 review management |
| 6 | Pricing & Packaging Strategist | `agents/pmm-pricing-packaging-strategist.md` | Sets the price architecture positioning converts into revenue: value metric, tier and packaging design, willingness-to-pay research, discount floors and the deal-desk matrix, price-change and migration comms, and AI-feature monetization |
| 7 | Agent Readiness Strategist | `agents/pmm-agent-readiness-strategist.md` | Makes the product evaluable, priceable and transactable by an AI agent: machine-readable pricing and catalog data, agent traversal of the buying path, API/docs/MCP as distribution, agent identity posture, and the autonomy and approval-gate design |
| 8 | International GTM Strategist | `agents/pmm-international-gtm-strategist.md` | Decides which countries you market into, in what order and how deep: market selection on observed pull rather than TAM, the four-rung localization ladder with its standing maintenance bill, in-region proof before in-region spend, a channel mix rebuilt per market, and the GDPR/ePrivacy questions sequenced before the campaign |
| 9 | Brand & Demand Strategist | `agents/pmm-brand-demand-strategist.md` | Owns the buyers who are not in the market yet: your own out-of-market share computed from your own replacement cycle, the demand-creation versus demand-capture split as an evidenced decision, category entry points and the distinctive-asset register, and a brand-measurement plan — baseline before spend, share of search with its B2B-volume limits, tracker, holdout — that survives the quarter someone asks you to justify it |

## Output Standards

### Positioning Quality Checklist

**Clarity**
- Positioning can be explained in 2-3 sentences (if it requires paragraph explanation, it's not clear)
- Problem statement is specific and resonates with target buyer (not generic/everyone's problem)
- Solution approach is differentiated from what competitors claim (not "we're better" but "we're different")
- Core differentiator is sustainable (not a feature competitor could copy, but approach/business model/team capability)

**Market Validation**
- Positioning is validated against customer interviews (did customers recognize the problem, did they agree with our approach?)
- Positioning wins against competitive alternatives in buyer mind (we own this positioning, competitors don't claim it)
- Positioning has proof: customer results, analyst validation, third-party benchmarks support the claim
- Positioning addresses buyer's evaluation criteria (what matters to them, not what matters to us)

**Sales Enablement**
- Sales team can explain positioning in 30-second pitch without script
- Positioning differentiates in competitive sales conversations (reps know how to position vs. each competitor)
- Messaging cascades to all sales assets (slides, one-pagers, emails, objection handlers align with positioning)

### Messaging Quality Checklist

**Buyer-Centric Language**
- Messaging uses customer benefit language, not feature language (e.g., "reduce compliance risk" not "built-in audit logging")
- Messaging addresses buyer's priorities and pain (not our priorities for what we want to talk about)
- Messaging language matches buyer's world (enterprise IT directors speak different language than startup founders)
- Messaging is specific, not generic (specific outcome like "reduce resolution time from 24 hours to 4 hours" not "improve efficiency")

**Proof Point Strength**
- Proof points are customer-focused (result for customer, not feature we built)
- Proof points are specific and measurable (not "improved performance" but "30% faster query response")
- Proof points are customer quotes where possible (more credible than our claims)
- Proof points include variety (customer results, analyst validation, industry benchmarks, third-party endorsements)

**Messaging Consistency**
- All messaging (web, sales, PR, demand gen) uses consistent core positioning and language
- Different buyer personas get tailored messaging (CFO hears different pitch than CTO) but core positioning consistent
- Messaging updates cascaded across all channels when positioning changes
- Sales and marketing messaging aligned (not contradicting each other)

### Quality Review Process

Before launching messaging or position to market:

1. **Customer Validation**: Have we tested this positioning/messaging with customers? Do they recognize the problem? Do they agree with approach?
2. **Competitor Check**: Can competitors claim this positioning or do we own it? Are we claiming something they're already claiming?
3. **Sales Usability**: Can sales team explain this without script? Does it help win deals?
4. **Proof Strength**: Do we have proof to support the claims we're making? (customer results, analyst validation, benchmarks)
5. **Messaging Consistency**: Does this align with brand voice and existing messaging?
6. **Compliance**: Are all claims substantiated? Are required disclaimers included?
