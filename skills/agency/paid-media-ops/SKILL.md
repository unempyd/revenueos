# Paid Media Operations Skill

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## What This Is

The Paid Media Operations skill brings together 7 specialized agents to manage end-to-end paid advertising for B2B SaaS companies. From strategic budget allocation and campaign setup to daily optimization, creative strategy, and attribution analysis, this team handles Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, social advertising, programmatic buying, and the media bought directly from publishers — newsletter, podcast and community sponsorships, paid review-site listings, and pay-per-lead content syndication. This skill enables you to achieve predictable cost-per-acquisition, maximize return on ad spend (ROAS), and scale acquisition channels with confidence.

## The Team: 7 Specialist Agents

| # | Agent | File | What They Do |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | PPC Strategist | `agents/paid-media-ppc-strategist.md` | Designs Google Ads account structure, campaign strategy, keyword lists, bidding strategies, and ad copy. Manages account setup, optimization, and ongoing QA. Handles search and Shopping campaigns. |
| 2 | Budget Optimizer | `agents/paid-media-budget-optimizer.md` | Analyzes spend patterns, identifies underperforming campaigns, reallocates budget to high-ROAS channels, models growth scenarios, and forecasts revenue impact of budget changes. Reconciles planned against delivered spend before fitting any curve, and maps audience collision across the portfolio — which of your own campaigns are taking each other's audience, the assignment order and exclusions that resolve it, the suppression register, and cross-channel frequency on one buying committee. |
| 3 | Creative Strategist | `agents/paid-media-creative-strategist.md` | Develops ad creative strategy across visual, copy, and messaging. Creates landing page concepts, A/B test plans, and creative hypotheses. Directs copywriter and designer resources. |
| 4 | Social Ads Specialist | `agents/paid-media-social-ads-specialist.md` | Manages Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter advertising. Develops audience targeting strategies, lookalike and custom audiences, and social-specific creative optimization. |
| 5 | Programmatic Buyer | `agents/paid-media-programmatic-buyer.md` | Manages programmatic display, audio, and video campaigns across exchanges and DMPs. Handles audience segmentation, bid strategies, and brand safety controls. |
| 6 | Attribution Analyst | `agents/paid-media-attribution-analyst.md` | Models multi-touch attribution, analyzes conversion paths, tracks CPA by channel and campaign, and reports true ROAS. Identifies attribution data gaps and improves measurement. |
| 7 | Sponsorship & Syndication Buyer | `agents/paid-media-sponsorship-syndication-buyer.md` | Buys the media no auction sells: newsletter, podcast and community sponsorships, industry-publication placements, paid review-site listings (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Software Advice), and pay-per-lead content syndication. Qualifies the outlet before the price, writes the insertion order that names delivery, reporting and remedy, and reconciles what ran against what was sold. |
