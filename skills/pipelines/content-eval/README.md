# Content Eval

**Expert panel scoring for content ideation.** Generate, score, and schedule content ideas using a simulated 7-expert panel — so only your best ideas make it to production.

## What It Does

1. **Gathers raw material** — Pulls from podcast transcripts, meeting notes, competitor analysis, and trending topics
2. **Runs competitive scan** — Identifies outlier videos, topic patterns, content gaps across your competitor set
3. **Generates ideas** — 20-30 ideas across long-form video, short-form video, and written formats, mapped to your messaging pillars
4. **Scores via expert panel** — Each idea is evaluated by 7 simulated experts (viral hooks, algorithm, brand, B2B buyer, differentiation, short-form adaptation, engagement)
5. **Ranks and schedules** — Passing ideas (85+ average) get sorted into a 4-week production calendar; everything else goes to the kill list with reasons

## Expert Panel

| # | Expert | What They Score |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Viral Hook Expert | Curiosity gap, scroll-stopping power, title strength |
| 2 | Algorithm Expert | CTR potential, watch time, search demand |
| 3 | Founder Brand Strategist | Pillar alignment, authenticity, personal experience |
| 4 | B2B Buyer Persona Expert | Would your target buyer watch this and want what you sell? |
| 5 | Content Differentiation Expert | Is anyone else making this? What's your unique angle? |
| 6 | Short-form Adaptation Expert | Can it clip into 3+ viral Shorts? Quotable moments? |
| 7 | Debate/Engagement Expert | Comments, shares, disagreements potential |

Pass threshold: **85+ average across all 7 experts.** No grade inflation.

## Configuration

Customize the skill by editing the reference files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/pillars.md` | Your 3 messaging pillars (what your content ladder maps to) |
| `references/panel.md` | Expert panel definitions and scoring criteria |
| `references/competitors.md` | YouTube competitor channel sets for scanning |
| `references/voice-rules.md` | Your brand's content voice and style rules |

## Usage
