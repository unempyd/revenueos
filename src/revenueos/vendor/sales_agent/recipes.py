"""Placeholder recipes — public, deliberately generic.

Real Example Brand copy lives in the private `ai_marketing_stack_sales_playbook`
package and overrides this stub at import time (see `sales_agent.agent.recipes`).

Data model (v3):
    Recipe   keyed on `pos_platform` enum
       └─ hooks: tuple[Hook, ...]  — multiple angles per platform
                                     for A/B variety; drafter picks one
                                     deterministically per lead via hash
            └─ Hook
                  name      — short identifier for analytics ("chains_have",
                              "chatgpt_test", "time_budget", "ai_shift")
                  subjects  — subject-line variants for this hook
                  opener    — first sentence (or "" to omit)
                  body      — value-prop prose; URL block + signature
                              get appended by the render layer per format
