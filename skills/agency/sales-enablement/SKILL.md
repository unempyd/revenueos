# Sales Enablement

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

### Sales Methodology & Frameworks

**Outbound Prospecting Model**
- Account selection (based on ICP: company size, industry vertical, use case fit, buying signal indicators)
- Multi-touch sequence: 3-5 touches over 2-4 weeks, multi-channel (email + LinkedIn + phone)
- Personalization: personalize at account level (company event, hiring trend, earnings announcement) not generic list
- Messaging: lead with problem (customer pain), not solution (your feature)
- Call-to-action: low-friction first ask (quick call, send an article, attend webinar, not demo request)
- Timing: mix of touch types, not all email day 1-5, day 7, day 14; vary channels

**Discovery Conversation Framework (MEDDPICC)**
- Metrics: What success metrics matter to the buyer (time savings, revenue, cost reduction)?
- Economic buyer: Who controls budget and makes yes/no decision? (Not just champion who bought from you.)
- Decision criteria: What is the buyer evaluating on (price, security, integration, speed, user experience)?
- Decision process: What are the buyer's formal steps to decide (RFP, vendor comparison, trial, executive sign-off)?
- Pain: What problem does the buyer have today that we solve? What's the cost of the pain?
- Implication: What are the downstream implications of the pain (hidden costs, productivity loss, compliance risk)?
- Champion: Who internally is advocating for us and why? Do they have budget influence?
- Commitment: What commitment did the buyer make to next step and timeline? (Not "let me think about it," but specific date.)

**Deal Progression Stages**
1. Early Funnel: Qualified opportunity, discovery call completed, pain and buyer identified, 20% close probability
2. Mid Funnel: Solution mapped to requirements, ROI quantified, multiple stakeholders engaged, 50% probability
3. Late Funnel: Proposal submitted, competitive position understood, executive sponsor aligned, 80% probability
4. Closed Won: Customer signed, implementation started
5. Closed Lost: Deal stalled >30 days or lost to competitor

**Proposal Development Process**
- Understand buyer's RFP/requirements (what did they ask for, what are the evaluation criteria)
- Map your solution to their specific requirements (not generic feature list, but specific feature + their use case)
- Quantify ROI and value (timeline to payback, annual value, cost avoidance)
- Address competitive positioning (why you beat alternatives on their stated evaluation criteria)
- Structure for buyer journey (executive summary for CFO, detailed technical specs for IT, change management for operations)
- Include risk mitigation (implementation support, training, success metrics, SLA guarantees)

**Competitive Win/Loss Analysis**
- Track which competitors we lose to most frequently (by deal size, industry, buyer persona)
- Analyze our win rates: against each competitor, by deal size, by vertical
- Conduct win/loss interviews with customers (why did you choose us, not competitor?)
- Identify where we're strong vs. weak vs. different from competitors
- Update battle cards with competitive positioning and win strategies

## Output Standards

### Sales Content Quality Checklist

**Outbound Messaging**
- Subject line captures attention without being salesy (e.g., "Quick question on your inventory system" vs. "Let's talk about our platform")
- Opens with specific detail about prospect's company (recent news, hiring pattern, tool usage) showing personalization
- Leads with customer pain or value, not your feature or company
- Call-to-action is low-friction and specific (e.g., "Can we set up 20 minutes Friday?" vs. "Let's grab a call soon")
- Each touch in sequence provides new reason to engage (new article, new connection point, third-party social proof)
- Tests for word count: <50 words in email opens, <100 words in full email

**Discovery Questions**
- All questions are open-ended (invite explanation, not yes/no)
- Questions follow logical flow: business context → pain/problem → current approach → gaps/implications → priorities
- Includes both situational questions (understand their world) and diagnostic questions (uncover pain)
- Avoids leading questions that telegraph your solution
- Questions are tailored to buyer role (IT director asks different than procurement director)

**Sales Proposals**
- Executive summary on page 1: situation (their world) → complication (their pain) → resolution (our approach) → ROI (specific savings/revenue)
- Problem statement uses customer's own words and metrics from discovery
- Solution maps directly to stated requirements (requirement A → our feature B → customer benefit C)
- ROI calculation is specific and conservative: timeline → cost avoidance + revenue/productivity → total value → payback period

### Quality Review Process

Before enabling sales team with any content:

1. **Accuracy Check**: All claims substantiated, no overstated capabilities, competitive comparisons factual
2. **Buyer Lens**: Does this resonate with the buyer's stated priorities? Or does it push what we want to talk about?
3. **Sales Usability**: Is this too wordy/corporate? Can a rep actually use this in a conversation?
4. **Messaging Consistency**: Does this align with positioning and messaging from marketing?
5. **Compliance Review**: Are all claims substantiated? Are required disclaimers included?
6. **Proof Check**: Do we have customer proof to back up the claims we're making?
