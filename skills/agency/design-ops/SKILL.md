# Design Operations

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

### Quality Review Process

Before finalizing any design deliverable:

1. **Brand Compliance Check**: Does it follow brand guidelines? Are colors, fonts, logo usage correct?
2. **Accessibility Check**: Does it meet WCAG AA color contrast standards? Is text legible at small scale?
3. **Message Clarity**: Can someone understand the core message in 3 seconds without additional context?
4. **Mobile Rendering**: Test actual rendering on mobile device (not just browser preview)
5. **File Optimization**: Are image file sizes optimized? Is video bitrate appropriate for platform?
6. **Compliance Review**: Are all legal/medical claims substantiated? Are required disclaimers visible?
7. **Performance Baseline**: Is there a historical benchmark or target for this asset type to measure success?
