# Marketing Analytics

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## What This Is

Marketing Analytics brings together performance analysts, conversion rate optimization specialists, customer insights researchers, data storytellers, and marketing operations architects to transform data into decisions. This skill orchestrates your analytics practice to measure what matters (pipeline impact, customer quality, efficient CAC), identify optimization opportunities (conversion rate improvements, targeting precision, channel efficiency), and communicate findings to stakeholders. Whether you're building a marketing dashboard, running an A/B test program, conducting customer research to understand buyer behavior, or presenting performance analysis to leadership, Marketing Analytics routes your request to the right specialist and ensures your data drives better marketing decisions.

## The Team: 8 Specialist Agents

| # | Agent | File | What They Do |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Performance Analyst | `agents/analytics-performance-analyst.md` | Measures and optimizes marketing performance across channels and campaigns, tracks KPIs, and identifies performance drivers through data analysis and reporting |
| 2 | Conversion Rate Optimizer | `agents/analytics-conversion-rate-optimizer.md` | Designs and executes CRO testing programs, analyzes conversion funnels, identifies friction points, optimizes user experience for higher conversion rates, and gates every experiment on whether the funnel can actually power it (sample size, duration, comparability horizon) |
| 3 | Customer Insights Researcher | `agents/analytics-customer-insights-researcher.md` | Designs and runs customer research (interviews, surveys, VoC mining) and grades what it can claim — sampling frame and non-response, evidence levels, cross-channel corroboration, saturation, jobs-to-be-done and research-based personas |
| 4 | Data Storyteller | `agents/analytics-data-storyteller.md` | Translates data analysis into clear narratives and compelling visualizations that communicate findings and drive decision-making |
| 5 | Marketing Ops Architect | `agents/analytics-marketing-ops-architect.md` | Designs the data architecture inside the stack — MAP/CRM integration, lead lifecycle and scoring, field governance — authors the marketing instrumentation contract (tracking plan, event taxonomy, UTM taxonomy) that every measurement audit grades against, implements tracking and attribution, and builds dashboards and reporting systems that enable data-driven marketing |
| 6 | GTM Data Strategist | `agents/analytics-gtm-data-strategist.md` | Owns the go-to-market data that arrives from outside — the data requirement written before shopping, provider bake-offs on a held-out sample of your own accounts, coverage scored separately from accuracy and wrong answers, identity-match corroboration, enrichment waterfalls ordered by measured cost per usable record, a decay rate measured rather than quoted, verification states including accept-all, suppression screening, and the provenance and lawful-basis record (GDPR Article 14) behind every acquired list |
| 7 | MarTech Stack Strategist | `agents/analytics-martech-stack-strategist.md` | Owns the martech stack as a portfolio: capability-first tool selection and build-vs-buy, shadow-tool and overlap rationalization, and the true switching cost of replacing a system — including the suppression record, engagement history, personalization layer and measurement continuity a platform migration puts at risk |
| 8 | Demand Planner | `agents/analytics-demand-planner.md` | Builds the number before the period starts — the revenue target decomposed backwards through the funnel into stage volumes, an assumption register where every conversion rate and cycle time is a dated own-funnel measurement or is stamped inferred, the sales-cycle lag that decides which period a lead can land in (carry-in, carry-out, latest useful creation date), the sales / production / addressable-audience ceilings that cap what a plan may promise, marginal rather than blended cost per source, a scenario band derived from your own plan-versus-actual dispersion instead of a borrowed ±20%, declared re-forecast triggers, and a versioned plan of record that makes a miss diagnosable |

### Testing Methodology

**CRO Testing Framework**
1. Hypothesis formation (based on data analysis or customer research insight)
   - Expected: Landing page headline focusing on outcome (vs. feature) will increase conversion rate
   - Why: Customer research showed buyers care about time savings more than features
   - Metric: Track conversion rate, form completion rate, downstream pipeline quality

2. Test design (control, test variant, sample size, duration)
   - Control: current page (baseline performance)
   - Variant: new headline focusing on outcome
   - Sample size: 100 conversions per variant to reach 95% statistical significance
   - Duration: 2 weeks or until sample size achieved

3. Execution (launch test, monitor for data quality)
   - Route 50% traffic to control, 50% to variant
   - Ensure proper tracking implementation (no missing conversions, no duplicate counts)
   - Monitor daily for anomalies (traffic drop, conversion spike indicating technical error)

4. Analysis (determine winner, measure impact, document learning)
   - Did test win or lose (statistical significance threshold: 95% confidence, 5% significance level)
   - If winner: magnitude of improvement (e.g., 12% lift in conversion rate = 0.5% absolute improvement)
   - If loser: why did it lose? Did it hurt downstream metrics (lead quality, sales conversion)?
   - Document learning: which element drove result (headline, color, form field, CTA placement)

5. Iteration (scale winner, test next hypothesis)
   - Scale winning variant to 100% traffic (or keep testing if hold-back analysis desired)
   - Identify next testing hypothesis based on remaining friction points
   - Queue up next test for launch

**Testing Prioritization**
- Prioritize tests by estimated impact × confidence level
- High-traffic pages (more statistical power) → test bigger changes
- Low-traffic pages → test smaller changes (less power) or focus on traffic growth
- Test single variable per test (isolates learnings)
- Test highest-impact elements first: traffic source → landing page → form completion → downstream quality

**Statistical Rigor**
- Sample size calculation: depends on baseline conversion rate, desired lift, desired significance level
- Significance threshold: 95% confidence (5% alpha, meaning 5% chance of false positive)
- Running time: continue test until sample size achieved or 2-4 weeks, whichever comes first
- Avoid peeking: don't declare winner until test complete (peeking inflates error rate)
