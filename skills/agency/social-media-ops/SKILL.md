# Social Media Operations Skill

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## What This Is

The Social Media Operations skill coordinates a team of 7 specialist agents to build brand visibility, drive engagement, and establish authority across social platforms. From strategic LinkedIn thought leadership and community building to YouTube content production and influencer partnerships, this team executes across every major social channel. This skill enables you to leverage organic social as a sustainable acquisition and brand-building channel, reducing dependence on paid media.

## The Team: 7 Specialist Agents

| # | Agent | File | What They Do |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | LinkedIn Strategist | `agents/social-linkedin-strategist.md` | Develops LinkedIn strategy, creates content calendar, writes thought leadership posts, manages engagement, and builds company and employee presence. Designs the first-hour distribution window, and owns **the subscription surfaces that compound** — whether to run a LinkedIn newsletter and how to scope it (the scope and the subscribers cannot be merged later), LinkedIn Events and the three permissions one Event produces (viewed / registered / marketing-consented), and Live eligibility checked in the planning window rather than launch week. Identifies influencer targets and partnership opportunities. |
| 2 | Twitter/X Strategist | `agents/social-twitter-strategist.md` | Manages Twitter/X brand presence, creates daily tweet content, builds industry conversations, engages with communities, and identifies viral opportunities. Handles both brand and executive accounts. |
| 3 | YouTube Producer | `agents/social-youtube-producer.md` | Plans YouTube content strategy, creates video scripts, outlines production workflows, manages video SEO, and builds subscriber growth. Handles long-form and short-form video (Shorts). |
| 4 | Reddit Specialist | `agents/social-reddit-specialist.md` | Identifies relevant subreddits, engages authentically in communities, answers questions, shares expertise, and develops soft-sell participation strategy. Prevents spamming while building credibility. |
| 5 | Community Builder | `agents/social-community-builder.md` | Develops community strategy, moderates discussions, identifies community leaders, enables user-generated content, and transforms followers into advocates. Manages Discord, Slack communities, forums. |
| 6 | Influencer Partnership Manager | `agents/social-influencer-partnerships.md` | Identifies relevant creators and **verifies their audience before you pay for it** — median engagement rather than the quoted mean, comment substance, inflated or pod-driven engagement, sponsored-post history. Structures and negotiates the deal, operates the FTC disclosure and post-publication monitoring the advertiser is liable for, and tracks partnership performance in pipeline. |
| 7 | Podcast & Audio Strategist | `agents/social-podcast-strategist.md` | Decides whether the company should run a show at all, builds the guest list as an account plan, books the guest tour on other people's shows, produces proofread transcripts and show notes, and holds the rights, consent and FTC disclosure register. Measures pipeline, never downloads. |
