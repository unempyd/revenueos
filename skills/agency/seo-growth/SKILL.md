# SEO Growth Skill

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## What This Is

The SEO Growth skill coordinates a team of 7 specialized agents to drive sustainable organic visibility for B2B SaaS companies. From foundational keyword research and technical audits to advanced AI search optimization and international expansion, this skill orchestrates every component of a modern SEO program. This team handles organic search strategy, execution, and measurement—enabling you to build compounding organic traffic that reduces your reliance on paid channels.

## The Team: 7 Specialist Agents

| # | Agent | File | What They Do |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Keyword Researcher | `agents/seo-keyword-researcher.md` | Conducts comprehensive keyword discovery identifying search volume, competition, intent, and opportunity gaps. Maps keywords to buyer journey stages (awareness, consideration, decision) and discovers the AI-answer-engine query landscape (conversational/fan-out questions) the AEO program is measured against. |
| 2 | Content Optimizer | `agents/seo-content-optimizer.md` | Optimizes existing web pages and blog articles for target keywords. Improves on-page elements (title tags, headers, body content) while maintaining natural, readable copy. |
| 3 | Technical Auditor | `agents/seo-technical-auditor.md` | Audits site health: crawlability, indexation, site speed, mobile responsiveness, Core Web Vitals, structured data, XML sitemaps, robots.txt configuration. Identifies and prioritizes technical fixes. |
| 4 | Link Building Strategist | `agents/seo-link-building-strategist.md` | Develops link building campaigns through outreach, partnerships, content-driven links, and earned media. Maps competitive link profiles and identifies high-value backlink opportunities. Also owns your presence on the third-party pages that hold your shortlist queries — "best [category] software" roundups, software directories, and review-platform category pages (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius) — including stale-entry corrections and keeping paid inclusions qualified rather than counted as earned links. |
| 5 | AI Search Optimizer | `agents/seo-ai-search-optimizer.md` | Optimizes content for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Claude search, Perplexity) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Improves visibility in AI-generated summaries and snippets. |
| 6 | Local & International SEO | `agents/seo-local-and-international.md` | Expands SEO strategy to international markets and local search. Validates hreflang as a reciprocal set (self-reference, return tags, `x-default`, per-locale canonicals), diagnoses the silent failures — IP auto-redirect hiding locales from Googlebot, stale translations, cross-locale canonicals — sets machine-translation review policy against Google's scaled-content-abuse rule, runs country-segmented Search Console reads for in-language demand, and answers the Google Business Profile eligibility test per market — routing markets with no staffed, customer-receiving location to the no-address branch (in-market links, regional directories, in-language coverage) instead of a virtual office or invented NAP. |
| 7 | Programmatic SEO Strategist | `agents/seo-programmatic-strategist.md` | Builds SEO from datasets and templates rather than drafts: integration, comparison, /vs and /alternatives and glossary pages at scale, with index-bloat and thin-content guardrails and internal linking across the set. |
