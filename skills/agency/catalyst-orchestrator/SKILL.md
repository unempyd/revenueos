# CATALYST Orchestrator: Master Marketing Framework

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before routing any work or producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Pass its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, along with the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

Brand context is what turns generic B2B SaaS output into output that sounds like the user's company. Skipping this step is the single most common cause of low-quality results.

## What This Is

CATALYST (Coordinated Agents for Targeted, Analytics-Led, Year-round SaaS Transformation) is the master orchestration framework for enterprise-scale B2B SaaS marketing. It coordinates 79 specialized agents across 12 functional categories executing campaigns from strategy through optimization. CATALYST is designed for organizations that need simultaneous execution across multiple disciplines—not sequential waterfall, but parallel execution with intelligent coordination, quality gates, and escalation procedures.

CATALYST operates in three modes:

1. **CATALYST-Full**: Complete annual planning (79 agents, 12+ weeks) for comprehensive GTM launches and year-round marketing strategy
2. **CATALYST-Sprint**: Focused 2-4 week campaigns (20-30 agents) for quarterly planning or major product launches  
3. **CATALYST-Micro**: Rapid 1-5 day execution (5-10 agents) for tactical campaigns or immediate needs

All three modes flow through six phase gates ensuring strategic clarity before build-out and data-driven optimization post-launch.

## CATALYST Framework Architecture: Coordination Model

### Handoff Protocols Between Phases

**Phase 0 → Phase 1 Handoff**
- Discovery findings (customer research, competitive analysis) become input to Strategy phase
- Strategic assumptions documented from Phase 0 research
- Personas and customer insights inform audience segmentation
- Competitive gaps inform positioning opportunities

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff**
- Positioning and messaging finalized before brand/creative system built
- Audience segmentation determines CRM data model and list structure
- Channel strategy determines technology stack configuration
- KPI framework determines analytics dashboard structure

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Handoff**
- Brand guidelines and design system enable content production
- CRM and automation configuration enables email sequences
- Analytics dashboard live before content launches for real-time tracking
- Compliance protocols established before customer-facing assets created

**Phase 3 → Phase 4 Handoff**
- All assets pass QA review before launch
- Tracking and analytics verified as live
- Sales team trained on enablement materials
- Performance baseline established on first day

**Phase 4 → Phase 5 Handoff**
- Daily performance data flowing into dashboards
- Weekly optimization cycles begin
- A/B tests initialized
- Budget reallocation recommendations generated

### Escalation & Risk Management

**Quality Gate Escalations**:
- **QA Failures**: Issues blocking launch escalated to Project Manager + client stakeholder within 4 hours
- **Performance Issues**: Campaign performance >20% below targets escalated within 48 hours with optimization plan
- **Compliance Issues**: GDPR/CAN-SPAM/legal violations escalated immediately with remediation plan
- **Budget Overruns**: Spend >10% above planned budget escalated within 24 hours with reallocation recommendation

**Project Risks**:
- Resource constraints → Project Manager reallocates across CATALYST phases
- Timeline slippage → Prioritize Phase 3 (Build) tasks and compress Phase 2 if needed
- Performance underperformance → Escalate to Strategy phase for repositioning

### Quality Checkpoints by Phase

## When NOT to Use CATALYST

CATALYST is designed for coordinated, multi-phase campaigns. Do NOT use CATALYST if:

- You need a **single-asset request** (e.g., "write a blog post") → Use specific category skill instead
- You need **tactical execution only** (e.g., "create an email") without strategy → Use specific category skill
- You need **immediate execution without planning** → Use CATALYST-Micro for rapid mode
- You need **ad-hoc consulting** (e.g., "should we do ABM?") → Use Strategy & Planning category

---

## Getting Started with CATALYST

0. **Load Brand Context**: Read `brand-context.md` (see [Step 0](#step-0-always-first-load-brand-context)). If it's missing, offer the [template](../../templates/brand-context.md) before going further.
1. **Assess Initiative Scope**: Is this CATALYST-Full (annual), CATALYST-Sprint (quarterly), or CATALYST-Micro (urgent)?
2. **Review Current State**: Do you have existing strategy (skip to Phase 2) or starting fresh (start at Phase 0)?
3. **Identify Key Stakeholders**: Who needs to approve strategy? Who owns execution?
4. **Allocate Resources**: Which agents/categories do you need? Full team or focused subset?
5. **Set Timeline & Milestones**: When does each phase gate need to complete?
6. **Invoke Specific Phase**: Start with the phase that matches your current state

**Example CATALYST-Sprint Initialization**:
- "We have existing positioning but need to execute Q2 campaign. Invoke Phase 2 (partial foundation setup) then Phase 3 (build) and Phase 4 (launch)"

**Example CATALYST-Full Initialization**:
- "We're launching into a new market. Invoke Phase 0 (discovery), Phase 1 (strategy), Phase 2 (foundation), Phase 3 (build), Phase 4 (launch), Phase 5 (optimize)"
