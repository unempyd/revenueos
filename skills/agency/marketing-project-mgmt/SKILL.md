# Marketing Project Management

## Step 0 (always first): Load brand context

**Before producing any deliverable, look for a `brand-context.md` file** in the user's project root (also check `./.claude/brand-context.md` and `./docs/brand-context.md`). It holds the company's ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, banned words, and compliance constraints.

- **If it exists:** read it in full and treat it as binding for this run. Hand its contents to every specialist agent you route work to, alongside the task brief. Its "Rules for agents reading this file" section overrides an agent's own defaults.
- **If it does not exist:** say so, point the user at the template ([`templates/brand-context.md`](../../templates/brand-context.md)), and offer to generate a filled draft by interviewing them or by reading their website and existing content. Then proceed with explicitly-labelled assumptions — never silently invented ones.

**Non-negotiable regardless of which path applies:** do not invent customer names, metrics, funding, integrations, certifications, or outcomes. Only proof recorded in `brand-context.md` (or supplied directly in the request) may be used as fact. Where a claim would help but no evidence exists, emit a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker in the deliverable rather than a plausible-sounding guess.

## What This Is

Marketing Project Management brings together campaign coordinators, client success managers, resource allocators, and agile marketing coaches to execute campaigns with precision and keep teams focused on high-impact work. This skill orchestrates the operational side of marketing—breaking down campaign complexity into manageable tasks, allocating constrained resources efficiently, running agile marketing sprints with clear outcomes, managing client expectations and deliverables, and ensuring teams don't get bogged down in busywork. Whether you're coordinating a multi-channel product launch, running a quarterly business review with a customer, building a resource allocation plan, or implementing agile marketing practices, Marketing Project Management routes your request to the right specialist and ensures your team ships quality work on time.

### Execution Model

**Campaign Execution (6-16 weeks depending on scope)**

Phase 1: Campaign Planning (Week 1-2)
- Campaign Coordinator works with marketing leadership to define campaign objectives, target audience, channels, timeline
- Break down campaign into key workstreams (demand gen, content, creative, analytics)
- For each workstream: identify deliverables, dependencies, resource requirements, timeline
- Build detailed project plan with tasks, owners, due dates, dependencies
- Get stakeholder alignment on timeline, dependencies, and resource requirements
- Identify critical path (dependencies that constrain overall timeline)

Phase 2: Team Mobilization & Kick-Off (Week 2-3)
- Resource Allocator confirms resource availability and allocates team members to campaign
- Campaign Coordinator runs campaign kick-off: brief team on objectives, timeline, roles, how success is measured
- Establish weekly cadence: status meetings, decision-making process, escalation path
- Marketing Ops Scrum Master: if using agile, run sprint planning meeting to build sprint backlog
- First deliverables assigned with clear due dates

Phase 3: Execution & Tracking (Week 3-14)
- Campaign Coordinator: weekly status tracking, deadline management, dependency coordination
- Weekly status meetings: report progress, identify blockers, adjust timeline as needed
- Marketing Ops Scrum Master: daily standups (15 min), sprint reviews (if using sprints), remove blockers preventing progress
- Resource Allocator: monitor team capacity, reallocate if bottlenecks emerge
- Quality reviews: Campaign Coordinator ensures deliverable quality before shipping
- Risk management: identify risks, adjust timeline/scope as needed

Phase 4: Launch & Measurement (Week 14-16)
- Campaign Coordinator coordinates simultaneous launch across all channels
- Ensures all tracking is properly implemented (UTM parameters, conversion pixels, event tracking)
- Monitoring dashboard: setup real-time tracking of campaign performance
- Daily monitoring: first week post-launch, check for technical issues, optimize based on early performance
- Campaign Coordinator documents launch readiness checklist and sign-offs

Phase 5: Post-Campaign Analysis & Retrospective (Week 17)
- Performance Analyst: performance review against KPIs and benchmarks
- Campaign Coordinator: operational retrospective (what worked in execution, what we'd change next time)
- Marketing Ops Scrum Master: team retrospective (how team performed, sustainable pace, learnings)
- Document learnings and apply to next campaign

### Resource Allocation Framework

**Capacity Planning Process (Quarterly)**
1. Inventory team capacity by role
   - Designers: 40 hours/week available, estimate hours per deliverable (landing page 16 hrs, ad creative 8 hrs, infographic 12 hrs)
   - Writers/Content: 40 hours/week available, estimate hours per deliverable (blog post 12 hrs, email sequence 8 hrs, case study 20 hrs)
   - Project managers: 30% capacity for coordination/meetings
   - Marketing ops: 30% capacity for analytics/tracking/reporting

2. Inventory competing demands
   - Campaigns in flight (ongoing demand gen, nurture, retention)
   - New campaigns launching next quarter (product launch, new audience, new channel)
   - Ongoing operational work (landing page maintenance, analytics reporting, tech updates)
   - Strategic/future work (positioning, new product evaluation, process improvements)

3. Estimate effort required for each initiative
   - High effort: 100+ hours (product launch, major campaign redesign)
   - Medium effort: 40-100 hours (feature launch, content campaign)
   - Low effort: <40 hours (optimization, small refresh, one-off deliverable)

4. Prioritize ruthlessly
   - Tier 1: must-do campaigns (product launch, board initiatives, enterprise customer needs)
   - Tier 2: should-do campaigns (optimizations, new channels, strategic initiatives)
   - Tier 3: nice-to-have (polish, innovation, exploration)
   - Only commit to Tier 1 + some Tier 2 (likely 60-70% of available capacity)
   - Hold 20-30% capacity buffer for urgent requests, blockers, revisions

5. Allocate resources
   - Assign team members to Tier 1 campaigns (primary focus)
   - Assign team members to Tier 2 campaigns (secondary focus, lower priority)
   - Leave 20-30% unallocated for flexibility and unexpected demands
   - Document allocation: who is assigned to what, % of time, timeline

### Agile Marketing Model

**Sprint Structure (1-2 weeks)**
- Sprint planning (day 1, 1 hour): team reviews backlog, estimates effort, commits to sprint
- Daily standup (10-15 min): what did I do yesterday, what am I doing today, any blockers
- Sprint execution (days 2-9): team works on committed tasks, no new work added mid-sprint
- Sprint review (day 10, 1 hour): demo completed work, celebrate wins, capture feedback
- Sprint retrospective (day 10, 45 min): what went well, what could improve, commit to actions
- Next sprint planning: planning kicks off for next sprint

**Agile Metrics**
- Velocity: how many story points team completes per sprint (trend over time)
- Burndown: visual tracking of work remaining vs. days remaining in sprint
- Capacity planning: velocity × number of sprints per quarter = how much work team can commit to
- Cycle time: average time from task creation to completion (indicates efficiency)
- Blockers: number of blockers per sprint and how quickly they're resolved

**Backlog Prioritization**
- Product backlog: full list of potential work (features, optimizations, fixes) prioritized by impact
- Sprint backlog: work committed for current sprint

### Quality Review Process

Before launching any project or campaign:

1. **Completeness Check**: Are all deliverables defined? Are all tasks assigned and dated? Are dependencies clear?
2. **Realistic Timeline**: Is timeline achievable given team capacity and complexity? Are there buffers for discovery/review?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Do stakeholders understand timeline, dependencies, and their role in approvals?
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong? Do we have mitigation plans?
5. **Resource Verification**: Do we have committed team capacity? Do team members agree to assignments?
6. **Success Criteria**: Is success clearly defined and measurable? Will we know if we achieved it?
