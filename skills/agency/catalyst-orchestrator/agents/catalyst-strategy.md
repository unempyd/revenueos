# CATALYST: Coordinated Agents for Targeted, Analytics-Led, Year-round SaaS Transformation

## Framework Overview

CATALYST is a comprehensive multi-agent orchestration framework designed specifically for B2B SaaS marketing teams. It coordinates 79 specialized marketing agents working across 12 functional categories to execute highly targeted, data-driven marketing campaigns from strategy through optimization and continuous improvement.

The framework is built on the principle that modern B2B SaaS marketing requires simultaneous execution across multiple specialized domains—from market research and strategic positioning to technical SEO, paid advertising, content production, and advanced analytics. Rather than sequential waterfall execution, CATALYST enables parallel agent execution with intelligent handoff protocols, quality gates, and escalation procedures.

### Philosophy

CATALYST operates on five core principles:

1. **Specialization with Coordination**: Each agent specializes in a narrow domain but works in concert with others through defined handoff protocols and shared objectives.

2. **Phase-Based Progress**: Work flows through six distinct phases (Discovery → Strategy → Foundation → Build → Launch → Optimize) with quality gates ensuring readiness before advancement.

3. **Flexibility in Scope**: Three operating modes allow CATALYST to scale from micro-campaigns (5-10 agents, 1-5 days) to full annual strategies (all 79 agents, 12+ weeks).

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Every phase produces metrics, insights, and validated assumptions that feed downstream work and inform optimization.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in feedback loops and attribution analysis ensure campaigns improve through iterative optimization and learning.

## Prerequisite: Brand Context

Before any phase begins, CATALYST loads the engagement's **brand context** — a single `brand-context.md` file in the project root capturing ICP, positioning, messaging pillars, citable proof, voice, terminology, and compliance constraints. Start from [`templates/brand-context.md`](../../../templates/brand-context.md).

Every agent receives this file alongside its task brief, and its rules override agent defaults. Two consequences matter:

- **Output is tailored, not generic.** Specialists write in the company's voice, to its ICP, against its real competitors.
- **Facts are bounded.** Agents may only assert customer names, metrics, certifications, and outcomes recorded in the brand context or supplied in the request. Anything else is emitted as a `[NEEDS INPUT: …]` marker, never invented.

If the file is absent, CATALYST offers to draft one and proceeds on explicitly-labelled assumptions. Phase 0 (Discovery) exists in part to fill the gaps a thin brand context leaves.

## Agent Coordination Model

### Work Handoff Protocol

Agents operate in three coordination patterns:

**Sequential Handoff** (Most common across phases)
- Upstream agent completes defined deliverables
- Quality gate review by designated approver
- Downstream agent receives documented handoff with specifications
- Feedback loops allow upstream revision if specifications unclear

**Parallel Execution** (Within phases)
- Multiple agents work simultaneously on interdependent tasks
- Daily sync meetings address blockers
- Shared asset repositories and version control
- Coordinated checkpoints at predefined milestones

**Continuous Integration** (Ongoing across all phases)
- Analytics agents continuously monitor campaign performance
- Optimization agents adjust based on real-time data
- Insights from optimization feed into future planning
- Monthly learning reviews capture insights for next cycles

### Communication Protocols

- **Daily Standups** (15 min): Active-phase teams report blockers and dependencies
- **Phase Gates** (1 hour): Review meetings at each phase boundary; approval to advance or remediations required
- **Weekly Syncs** (30 min): Cross-functional alignment on upcoming work and emerging issues
- **Async Documentation**: All handoffs documented in specification templates; detailed enough for independent work
- **Escalation Path**: Blockers → Team Lead → Director of Marketing → Executive Sponsor

### Agent Specialization & Responsibilities

Each agent owns:
- Defined input specifications (what they need to receive)
- Domain expertise (knowledge framework for their specialty)
- Deliverable templates (standardized outputs)
- Quality standards (criteria for "done")
- Handoff documentation (how they pass work to next agent)

Agents maintain continuous improvement through:
- Personal learning logs (tools, techniques, frameworks discovered)
- Competitive intelligence updates (staying current in their specialty)
- Peer knowledge sharing (monthly specialty team huddles)
- Performance metrics (how their work impacts downstream results)
